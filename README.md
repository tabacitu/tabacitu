# Hey! I'm Tabacitu 👋   

I build online products and help others do the same. I'm based in Bucharest (Romania), but work almost as much from cafes and coworking spaces around the world.

> I think life is simple, we make it complicated. Same with web development. 

That's why I warned people against unnecessarily adopting some trends for the past 10 years. I saw microservices, SPAs, large JS frameworks as something only 1% of apps should use, not 99% - most people didn't listen. I finally feel vindicated in 2024, seeing my little corner of the internet finally moving to monoliths, HTMX, Livewire, Alpine etc. Feels like the share of people who like to "_keep it simple_" is growing again. Can't wait for people to also see NPM as toxic (just like its founder does). Other than that, I'm a happy camper.

I love my stack and the people in it. I feel we've got 90% of the things we need to quickly build & maintain web apps. I'm working on the next 5%.
